# EventManagementSystem-OOD-Assignment
It's an Object-Oriented Design project that requires an 8-member group to complete a Ticket Management System website from scratch.

_Since it's a project assigned by our teacher, I cannot change the visibility but provide a link and proof of my contribution as the team leader._

This project includes 4 parts: 
1. **Requirements**: This phase is to set up a blueprint for the projects from all the requirements given. We wrote out all the possible Core Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements, analysed System Boundaries, complete Role Analysis (Actors), produced Use Case Description documents, Use Case Diagram, Domain Model, System Glossary for all 19 use cases, and drew UI Prototypes/Sketches for every page.

2. **Analysis**: This phase continues the development process by realizing the courses of events that we described in the requirements analysis phase. This requires the creation of sequence diagrams with a detailed description for each course of events and a class diagram.

3. **Design**: This phase continues the development process by performing further realisations on the courses of events that we described in the analysis phase. This requires the creation of new sequence diagrams with a detailed description for each course of events (about 40 Sequence Diagrams overall). These diagrams will be more detailed in that they will contain all parameter and type infromation. Additionally, the diagrams will now include the UI and database components of the system. We also detailed the Class Diagram.

4. **Implementation**: This part includes the implementation of the restaurant example system and provides friendly introductions for each element and steps to run the program. In practice, we made use of the following features: Java 21, Maven, Docker, Docker Compose.

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Web-Based Event and Ticket Management System
- **Project Description**: This project aims to design and implement a web application built on the Spring Boot framework, focused on managing events, venues, and tickets. The system’s users include administrators, organizers, and regular users, each with different functional permissions.
- **Development Platform**: Spring Boot Web Application

## System Objectives
- The system aims to provide efficient and user-friendly solutions for event and ticket management by incorporating functionalities for account management, venue management, event management, and ticket management. Three main user roles (Administrator, Organizer, and User) will utilize the system to perform relevant management and ticket purchasing functions, enhancing event organization and user experience.
